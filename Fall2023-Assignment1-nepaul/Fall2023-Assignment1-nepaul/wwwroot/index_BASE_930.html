        <p id="Summary">Carmen Berzatto, a brilliant young chef from the fine-dining world is forced to return home to run his local family sandwich shop - the Original Beef of Chicagoland - after a heartbreaking death in his family. A world away from what he's used to, Carmy must balance the soul-crushing reality of trading in Michelinu star restaurants for the small 1business' kitchen filled with strong-willed and obstinate staff and his strained familial relationships, all while grappling with the impact of his brother's suicide.</p>
